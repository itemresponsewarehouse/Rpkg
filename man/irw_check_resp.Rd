\title{Check response patterns in IRW data}
\usage{
irw_check_resp(x, min_count = 5L, min_prop = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame in long format with columns \code{id}, \code{item},
\code{resp}, or the result of \code{irw_long2resp()}.}

\item{min_count}{Minimum count for a category before it is considered
sparse (only used when \code{x} is long-format). Default is 5.}

\item{min_prop}{Minimum within-item proportion for a category before it
is considered sparse (only used when \code{x} is long-format).
Default is 0.01.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\code{single_category_items} (character vector of item IDs) and
\code{sparse_category_items} (named list of data frames with columns
\code{resp}, \code{count}, \code{prop}).
}
\description{
Summarize basic response diagnostics in IRW data, including items with a
single observed response category and sparse categories in polytomous items.
}
\details{
When \code{x} is long-format (with columns \code{id}, \code{item}, \code{resp}),
diagnostics are recomputed using \code{min_count} and \code{min_prop}. When
\code{x} is the wide-format result of \code{irw_long2resp()}, any attached
diagnostics from \code{check_resp = TRUE} are returned directly.

A response category is treated as "sparse" if it has fewer than
\code{min_count} observed responses OR a within-item proportion smaller than
\code{min_prop}.
